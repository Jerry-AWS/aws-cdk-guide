# About the Reference<a name="reference"></a>

See the [AWS CDK Reference](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/) for information about the AWS CDK libraries\.

Each library contains information about how to use the library\. For example, the [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-s3-readme.html) library demonstrates how to set default encryption on an Amazon S3 bucket\.
